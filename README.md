## 🧩 Project Overview

FlightX simulates an aircraft operating in a virtual environment where users can actively control movement and observe responsive, realistic motion behavior. The simulation is powered by a real-time game loop that continuously updates physics calculations, processes user input, and renders smooth animations.

This project serves as:
- A learning tool for understanding fundamental flight mechanics  
- A foundation for developing more advanced flight simulation systems  
- A demonstration of Python-based simulation and game development practices
